# Kurb

optimizes the carbon-efficiency of Kubernetes workload.

# Goal

Run workload where and when carbon-efficient energy is available for computing.

# Method

Configure the Kubernetes scheduler to create pods on the eligible nodes with the highest carbon-efficiency and subsequently the lowest greenhouse gas emissions.

# Rationale

Carbon-efficient energy sources are more variable than other sources.
This affects the availability of carbon-efficient energy to substantial consumers like data centers.
Computing workload is relatively free in both time and space.
Following the availability of carbon-efficient energy along the globe improves the carbon-efficieny of cloud computing.
